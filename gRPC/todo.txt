1. Proto file includes all the necessary service methods and message types for 
    the various operations that can be performed by the Sellers and Buyers on the Market.

    cmd to be run:
    protoc -I=. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. shopping_platform.proto


2. Complete the Implementations: Fill in the logic for each method in market.py, seller.py, and buyer.py.
    This will involve handling the request and response messages defined in your proto file.

3. Generate gRPC Code: Use the protoc compiler to generate Python gRPC code from your proto file. 
    This step is crucial for your scripts to work.

4. Test Each Component:

Start by running market.py to initiate the server.
Then run instances of seller.py and buyer.py to simulate the interactions.
Test each functionality (like registering a seller, adding an item, searching for an item, etc.) to ensure the system works as expected.
